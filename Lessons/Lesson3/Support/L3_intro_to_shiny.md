## Exercise - Shiny App  

#### Basic Setup
> Open RStudio and create two new R files in `../Lessons/Lesson3/Exercises/` in your local repository.  

> The minimum code for a working `shiny` app are the following lines saved in **`server.R`**
``` r
library(shiny)
server <- function(input, output){}
```
> and this line of code saved in **`ui.R`**
``` r
ui <- fluidPage()
```
> Add this code to your files.  

> To see the result we have to save these two scripts and run code in **`server.R`**.  
> A browser tab will be opened and we should see empty web page.  

#### What have we set up
> At the start of every `shiny` app we will have to load `shiny` library to be able to run any app by `library(shiny)` command.
> In `server.R` server part of `Shiny` app is defined. It must be a function with input and output parameters.  
> `ui.R` file defines user interface. It must return a `fluidPage()` object that  basically rewrites R functions to HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes and hence does all the web developement work for us.  
> This piece of code is a template that can be used at the start of development of any `shiny` app.  

### Inputs and outputs
> Basically every `shiny` app consists of two types of elements - inputs and outputs. We will use these to interact with a user and with our `server.R` scripts. 
> These two types of elements are put as arguments to `fluidPage()`.
<pre><code>
ui <- fluidPage(
  <i># Input() element(s), </i>
  <i># Output() element(s) </i>
)
</code></pre>
> Everything we put in the `fluidPage` object will be what will appear on the web page of our `shiny` app.

#### Fluid Page Inputs
> Since we want to have an interactive interface to make a user able to interact with the R script running in the backgroud (`server.R`), we will need some elements where the user will be able to pass some input to our script.  
> In `shiny` there are many input elements that are ready for use, for example dropdown menus, buttons, sliders etc. These elements are called **widgets**. Widgets have simple syntax with their own sets of required parameters to run correctly. All widgets have first two mandatory arguments:

- a **inputId** - This is a very important parameter. It is the code name of the widget that is invisible for a `shiny` app user but we will need it in our R codes to reference the values provided from the widget. The name must be unique for every widget of the `shiny` app.

- a **label** - The label appears on the web page created by the `shiny` app. It should be a string (can be also an empty string).

> To see available widgets with explanation of values that they return and their respective R codes visit [this link](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html).

> Let's change `ui.r` code to this:
``` r
ui <- fluidPage(
	sliderInput(
		inputId = "chosen_number",
		label = "Choose a number",
		value = 7,
		min = 1,
		max = 100
	)
)
```
> We can run this new app from `server.r`. New input element (slider) will appear obn our webpage. In addition to `inputId` and `label` we had to provide three more parameters for `min`(minimal value), `max`(maximal value) and `value`(initial value). These three parameters are mandatory for `slicerInput` widget.

#### Fluid Page Otputs
> Outputs are web page elements that are used to display some content to a user. The outputs are elements that can be changed as the user interacts with the input elements of the app, or as the R script is executed. For example we can output data in form of plots, tables or text.

> Just like in case of inputs for every type of output there is a separate function. Every output has to have one parameter and that is `outputId`. This is again the code name that should be unique and will be used in our R script to interact with the output in our `shiny` app.

> To see all types of output functions, visit [this page](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.0.5/), section "UI Outputs".

> Let's try to use it in our `shiny` app. Firstly, we will update the `ui` code. 
``` r
ui <- fluidPage(
    sliderInput(
        inputId = "chosen_number",
        label = "Choose a number",
        value = 7,
        min = 1,
        max = 100
    ),
    plotOutput(outputId = "chart")
)
```
> Since we want to display some output, we will have to put some output function to the `fluidPage` element. In this case it is `plotOutput` function.

> We can run the `shiny` app now.

> There are a couple of things to notice here.  
> First is that elements contained in the `fluidPage` are separated by commas.  
> Also there is nothing much to see in the app. That's because we have just created a room for the `plotOutput` on the page.  

> Now we know how to add input and output elements to the `fluidPage`. But we also want to see some output from the app. To achieve this, we will have to make some changes in our `server` code.

### Putting inputs and outputs together
> Until now we have looked at separate elements of shiny app. Now we will make these elements work together. This part takes place in the `server` function of a shiny app.  
> The concept of working with inputs and outputs in our shiny app is fairly simple. The key elements here are the parameters of the server function and IDs of the input and output elements.  
> The server function in our case occupies a single code called `server.R`. The function has two parameters - input and output. We use these parameters when we want to work with inputs and outputs, respectively.  

#### Inputs
> When we want to use a value that is passed from a user to the app by an input widget, we reference this value using the input parameter of the server function and the name of the widget. For example if we want to use the value from the slider in our app, we would reference the value from the slider as `input$chosen_number`. This is because we set the `inputId` parameter of the slider to be `chosen_number`.

#### Outputs and render functions
> To create a visible output in a shiny app we have to use the output parameter of the server function. Just like we did it with the inputs, we use the parameter and the output ID of the output element.  
> Compared to the inputs, there is one more step we have to do to really display something in an app. We will need a render function.  
> **Render function** is a function that takes R code as an argument and uses this code to render an output object to display a visible output in an app. We can put there a single command but if we use curly brackets inside a render function, we can put there unlimited number of lines of R code or run an entire R script from there.  
> Similarly to the inputs and output, there are several types of render functions. We use different render functions based on the type of the output we want to display. These functions in some cases create analogous pairs with the output functions, for example `plotOutput` and `renderPlot` or `textOutput` and `renderText`.  
> To see all types of the rendering functions please visit "Renderig functions" section on [this page](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.0.5/).  

> Now let's try it out in our app from the previous example. We will do it in two steps. The first step will be that we will render a plot in our app. For example we can display a histogram of 100 random numbers generated from uniform distribution. We will use the same `ui.R` as before but we will make a couple of changes in `server.R`. It will look like this  
``` r
library(shiny)

server <- function(input, output){
    output$chart <- renderPlot(
        hist(runif(100))
    )
}
```
> When we run this app (do not forget to **Save** your changes), we should see our slider, and a chart that is completely unrelated to the value that is provided by the slider. We haven't connected them yet but we will do it in the second step.   

> What we want to do now is to take the value that a user chooses using the slider and use it to generate the selected number of random numbers. Using the instructions from this section we will further modify the server function to look like this
``` r
library(shiny)

server <- function(input, output){
  output$chart <- renderPlot(
    hist(
      runif(input$chosen_number),
      ylim = c(0, 20)
    )
  )
}
```
> This time the slider is connected to what we see on the plot. When the slider moves, it returns a new value which is then used to generate a different number of random values which are then displayed on the chart. `ylim` parameter of `hist` function fixes y axis such that the effect of moving the slider is more visible.  
> A thing to note here is that we don't have to write any line of code to tell our app to watch out for the changes of the slider. This is carried out automatically by shiny and it is called reactivity. Now we have basically built a simple shiny app with a reactive input slider and a reactive output histogram.
