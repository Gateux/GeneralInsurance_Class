# Basic GitHub Actions

In this section we will provide a brief description of how to do some of the basic GitHub actions that we will require you to use throughout this course. To see what these actions actually mean and what they do, please look at the previous section.

### Fork

We will start with the fork, since this will be the first thing you will need to do to get all the course material to your repository. To fork someone else's repository, you need to find the original repository first. So in this case you want to find our GeneralInsurance_Class repository. Then you need to click on the fork button

### Commit

In previous section we described how the committing works. Now we will have a look at how to do it in GitHub.

To make a change in a file on GitHub go to the file, open it and start editing it.

When you're done, scroll down and click on "Commit Changes" button. To be able to submit the commit a commit header will have to be edited. Then, if you think the changes you made need longer description, you can add additional comments in the commit message box.

You can submit your commit either directly to your master branch (this option is the one you should do in this course) or you can choose to create a new branch with the new commit

Commits are the way you will submit your solutions to homework assignments.
