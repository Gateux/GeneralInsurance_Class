# Git and GitHub

### What is Git
Git is a version control system that helps developers to keep track of the changes in their codes and/or other files. This system was created to enable programming collaboration while being able to compare the changes between the separate code submissions and to compare the changes of code between developers.

It was created by Linus Torvalds for development of Linux. To learn more about the history of Git, have a look at its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).


### What is GitHub
GitHub is a web service that enables users to have an online version control system using Git. On GitHub you can create an account where you can have your own repositories (=Git projects) and take advantage of Git integration.
